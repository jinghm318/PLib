================================================================================

PLib is a collection of PHP classes intended to make everyday PHP programming
a bit easier. This is an early release and some of the classes are pretty new
so bugs might, or probably will, occure. I, Pontus Ã–stlund, have put up a site
where I will put new releases for download - http://plib.poppa.se.


REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing is sure: You'll need PHP5 but what particular version is required
I don't know. The libraries have been developed on version 5.2.1 but some 
classes have beed developed on older versions of PHP all the way back to 
5.0.5. 

Of course some classes depends on special PHP modules. Here's a quick list:

  * DOM
  * SimpleXML
  * SQLite
  * XML
  * XSL
	
but if classes depending on these modules isn't being used the other classes 
will still work.

The PLib library is developed on Linux so many of the classes will probably 
not work on Windows. I will try them out on Windows when I get access to PHP
enabled Windows machine ;)


INSTALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to put the PLib dir anywhere. All you need to do is to 
include PLib.php in you script. So say you put "plib-{version}" in your home
directory just include PLib.php like this

	#lang=php
	<?php
	require_once '/home/username/plib-{version}/PLib.php';
	// Import the HTTP client for instance
	PLib::Import('Protocols.HTTPClient');
	...
	?>
	
And that's that for now!
