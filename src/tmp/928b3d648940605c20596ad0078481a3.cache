			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems Wordpress is hard coding the domain name into the database. How smart is that, or have I missed something? When I first set the site up on my local development server I soon noticed that various links were written hard with the domain and everything. Obviously that would f**k thing up once the site was moved to the public server. So I went into the settings and saw that there were two fields &#8211; Wordpress address and Blog address &#8211; containing absolute paths. So I changed them to relative onces, e.g <code>/blog</code> instead of <code>http://strindberg.loc/blog</code> and things seemed to work properly.</p>
<p>Now I just realized that the <code>guid</code>s in the RSS feed pointed to my development server. I looked in the database table and saw that there were hard coded references to <code>http://strindberg.loc</code>. So with a little <code>UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = REPLACE(guid, 'strindberg.loc', 'www.poppa.se')</code> I thought I had solved the problem. But then I realized some other <code>guid</code>s in the RSS is generated on the fly, and they get f**ked up since the <code>Wordpress address</code> now is relative and thus some <code>guid</code>s looks like <code>http:///blog/some-url/</code>. Is that good or what?</p>
<p>And try to figure out how to find out where those <code>guid</code>s gets generated. My idea was to find where they are generated and there insert the <code>HOST</code> dynamically, but since there&#8217;s a zillion <code>apply_filter(...)</code> it&#8217;s virtually impossible to find where the shit gets generated (thanks to <a href="http://netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> it&#8217;s otherwise simple to follow the chain of execution. Just <code>ctrl+click</code> on a function call and the source of that function will be loaded.)</p>
<p>Ok, so now I have to put on my Sherlock hat and see if I can solve this. I find it hard to believe you shouldn&#8217;t be able to move a Wordpress site from one domain to another without having to work your ass off!</p>
<p>If anyone have a solution &#8211; it&#8217;s perfectly possible I&#8217;m missing out on something here &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to know!</p>

<p>It hit me I hadn&#8217;t done anything to my site for three years. After all I&#8217;m a web developer and some kind of standard must be met and kept!</p>
<p>The previous version of this site was built on my home cooked blog application. But that was written three years ago and you learn, and develop skills, a lot over three years, so I didn&#8217;t feel like reusing it and it was kind of limited regarding lots of stuff &#8211; like social networkning &#8211; that has emerged over the past few years.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m an open source advocat I decided to live as I learn and went for <a title="Wordpress web site" href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. It was really simple to setup and the admin interface is rather uncluttered and easy to use. Although I&#8217;m not too fond of how the backbone of Wordpress is coded and structured it&#8217;s fairly easy to bolt on your own functionality.</p>
<p>Hopefully this new version of the site will make me write more than two posts a year, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on it <img src='/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day at work I was hacking up a console application that converts an Excel workbook to chosen format. This is to be used in a web application where some people can upload an Excel file that will populate a <a title="Visit MySQL" href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> database. To make it easier to parse the Excel file the console application will save a copy of the file as a tab separated file that is easier to parse (I will share the code when done).</p>
<div class="image"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/vs-express-def.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-202" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/vs-express-def.png/530" alt="vs-express-def" /></a><br />
<span class="caption">Visual C# 2008 default layout</span></div>
<p>Anyhow! At work I use Visual C# 2008 Express Editon when &#8211; very rarely &#8211; hacking C# and it annoyed me that the code part was too far to the left for me to feel comfortable. So I though I could displace the right column with class viewer and solution explorer and put that on my right screen, narrowing the main window and put farther to the right on my left screen.</p>
<div class="image" style="width:270px;float:right;margin:-5px 0 10px 10px"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/vs-error.png"><
2000
img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-207" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/vs-error.png/250" alt="Error message when Visual C# crashes" /></a></div>
<p>So I did and it felt alright &#8211; until I tried to compile the application. Visual C# just crashed big time! I didn&#8217;t have any clue why at that moment so I fired it up again and had to displace the right column again and put everything where I wanted it. I tried to compile again and boom, crash again!</p>
<p>So I thought: What the heck! Fired the thing up again, displaced the right column but this time I thought I&#8217;d just close the application so it would remember my settings the next time it was started. So I just hit <code>ALT+F4</code> and boom, crash again. After repeating this again I came to the conclusion that Visual C# 2008 crashes if you displace the right column and then tries to either compile the current project or close the application it self. There&#8217;s probably some other actions that will cause it to crash as well.</p>
<div class="image"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/vs-express.png"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/vs-express.png/530" alt="vs-express" /></a><span class="caption">My desired layout</span></div>
<p>The final conclusion is that I will have to use the application layout dear Microsoft has decided I should use. Thank you very much! Okey, I can live with it but it&#8217;s a bit annoying!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was working on a simple database to Excel XML exporter the other day and decided to write it in C. Now, the problem was that since the Swedish language contains non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii">ascii</a> characters the output needs to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> encoded. C doesn&#8217;t have a built-in function for this &#8211; it seems I should add since I&#8217;m a C rookie &#8211; and no matter how I searched at Google I couldn&#8217;t find anything useful. So I thought&#8230;</p>
<h2>Look at PHP</h2>
<p>&#8230;why not look at the source code of <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> and see how the PHP functions <code>utf8_encode</code> and <code>utf8_decode</code> are being done. So I downloaded the source of PHP and with a little <code>find . -name *.c -print | xargs grep "utf8_encode"</code> I found the functions in <code>xml.c</code>. Thankfully they weren&#8217;t too complicated &#8211; when dug out from the rest of the XML functions &#8211; so I didn&#8217;t take too long before I had them as standalone functions.</p>
<p>This is how they are used:</p>
<pre><code lang="cpp">#include "utf8.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *iso_str = "Pontus Ã–stlund";
  char *utf8_str;

  utf8_str = utf8_encode(iso_str);
  iso_str  = utf8_decode(utf8_str);

  return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>And it seems to be working quite OK!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anybody working on a replicated web site (with an edit/backend server and one or more frontend servers) with perhaps lots of sub sites has probably experienced the hassle of switching domains between the backends and frontends.</p>
<p>Say you get an email saying: Can you change &#8230; to &#8230; on <code>http://some-front-end.com/some/path/to/a/page.html</code>. You click on the link, since you&#8217;r lazy, and then have to change the domain in the address bar to your backend domain and 40% of the time you misspell and have to go up there again and&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyhow! I got tired of this so I created a domain swapping extension to Firefox. It adds a context menu (right-click on any page) where you can choose to change to another domain &#8211; the URL will stay intact.</p>
<p>So if you are working with replicated sites the extension is free to download at:<br/><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have found a new time waste &#8211; playing with Photoshop and <a href='http://www.gimp.org'>Gimp</a> to create desktop wallpapers. I must say Gimp isn&#8217;t too bad although it&#8217;s quite far behind Photoshop when it comes to usability and especially layer styles. I downloaded a <a href='http://registry.gimp.org/node/186'>plug-in</a> that works pretty well and similar to the effects in Photoshop, but the big difference is that the effects will be put in separate layers in Gimp which means you can&#8217;t fine tune them in real time afterwards. And one really misses the layer folders! Anyway, Gimp works pretty well and when you get used to the differences from Photoshop and you learn the shortcuts it&#8217;s quite usable after all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the Roxen User Conference has come to an end. It&#8217;s always nice to meet with people who speak the same &#8220;language&#8221; (the language of the geeks perhaps), to share experiences and solutions. And of course it was nice to see the <a href='http://www.roxen.com/products/ep/'>Roxen Editorial Portal</a> in action. That&#8217;s a pretty cool piece of web based software. It was also nice to get a preview of <a href='http://www.roxen.com/products/cms/'>Roxen CMS</a> 5.0. It will have a few new features that will be nice and perhaps the greatest thing is that it will incorporate <a href='http://pike.ida.liu.se'>Pike</a> 7.8 (which in it self hasn&#8217;t been released yet).</p>
<p>Anyway! For me it was a great experience talking to other Roxen customers and share some ideas and views. Oh, and one more nice thing: during the conference Roxen released a community site &#8211; <a href='http://planet.roxen.com/'>planet.roxen.com</a>. I hope it will be a great resource for us Roxen customers and users. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so now the first day of Roxen User Conference is about to end. The has been some interesting speaks today and a few new acquaintances. The most impressive thing is to have see how different companies and institutions have implemented the Roxen platform. To me Roxen is not just a CMS but a great development platform and from my new experiences from all over the world today my conclusion is I&#8217;m not the only one with that standpoint. </p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s been a few drinks (beer, wine, whiskey and what not) but also some new friends and faces to known names. And of course there&#8217;s also been some sharing of code concepts and what not.</p>
<p>Tomorrow there will be some more hands on workshops. Roxen will demo their new &#8220;Link management module&#8221; which will be part of the 5.0 release. It looks really promising from the previews we&#8217;ve seen today.</p>
<p>In the 5.0 release they will also bring to live a new patch module which will ease the maintenance of a Roxen empowered server park in a tremendous way. That feature will be awesome.</p>
<p>One cool thing in particular is to have seen a demo of the Roxen Editorial Portal. A few newspapers are already running it located from Sweden to USA to Australia. A really cool achievement for such a new product! You guys at Roxen rules!</p>
<p>I will give a new sum-up of tomorrow&#8217;s events! </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after five weeks of vacation I&#8217;m back at work. The most sensational thing must be that I didn&#8217;t write a single line of code in these five weeks! It was a much needed break from computers and the longest one I&#8217;ve had for the nine years or so I&#8217;ve been programming. The vacation it self isn&#8217;t much to talk about. I visited friends and family and spent a lot of time in the sofa watching the olympics &#8211; and playing some Play Station 3 as well <img src='/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I also just bought an Asus EEE which I think is quite cool. I&#8217;m actually writing this blog post on it. I threw out the <a href='http://www.xandros.com/'>Xandros</a> operating system and installed <a href='http://www.ubuntu-eee.com'>Ubuntu EEE</a> instead which feels a great deal better. I&#8217;ve installed a lot of developer tools and they actually run rather smoothly.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just created an updated version of Roxen Launcher. I got an error report from one who tried to build the application:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">./ApplCon.cs(232,24): error CS0122:<br />
&#8216;System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener.Server&#8217; is inaccessible due<br />
to its protection level</p>
<p>An <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ha94aebs.aspx">explanation of the error</a> can be found at MSDN. The reason seems to be due to <code>TcpListener.Server</code> being a protected property but I tried to access it as public. The strange thing is that I didn&#8217;t get an error about it nor on my machine at home or at work. Now I created a derived class of <code>TcpListener.Server</code> so that I can access the protected property.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see if it works!</p>
