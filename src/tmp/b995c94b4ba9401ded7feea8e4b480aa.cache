		<title>Roxen Application Launcher 0.4.5</title>
		<description>

Okey, here comes an update of my Roxen Application Launcher (come again?) for Linux. 

There's no major changes to this release. The connection to the Roxen server is now stored in a shared object so that it can use a "keep-alive" connection. Not that I think it matters a great ...</description>

		<title>Blue Screen of Death</title>

You don't get surprised when you get to work one morning and your monitors looks like this, given your computer is running the bless from Redmond!

Man I wish I was running Linux at work as well! 

(And no: I hardly drink any Coca Cola at all ;)) </description>

		<title>GTK hacking in Pike</title>
		<description>I've found out that it's great fun programming desktop applications and of course it gets more fun the more you learn. Now I'm doing a Twitter client in Pike - my favorite programming language - mostly because I wanted to try out GTK programming in Pike. I use the good ...</description>

		<title>Roxen Application Launcher 0.4.4</title>
		<description>So, here's a new release of the Roxen Application Launcher for Linux (RAL). The previous versions used my home made (sloppy so) HTTP client which didn't handle redirects or secure connections - thank you tec for the feed back - since I had some major problems getting libsoup working with ...</description>

Unwanted line breaks in text copied from PDF

Anybody working with information sooner or later have to copy and paste text from PDF-files. And anybody who has done that knows what a pain in the a** that is! You get actual line breaks from the visual line breaks in the PDF. ...</description>

		<title>Bitlyfier &#8211; A Bit.ly client for GNOME</title>
		<description> For those of us tweeting - or sharing web addresses in general - these long addresses with extensive query strings you wan't to share isn't too user friendly. So we have Bit.ly, among others, that lets you shorten a URL - or give it an alias if you like ...</description>

		<title>JavaScript URI class</title>
		<description>The other day I needed an URI class for JavaScript. I was doing some stuff where I needed to alter certain parts of an URI. I bet there's a couple of URI classes for JavaScript out there but I can be a bit nit-picky about code and how it's written ...</description>

		<title>New Roxen Application Launcher for Linux written in Vala</title>
		<description>A couple of weeks ago I stumbled upon a fairly new programming language named Vala. I thought it looked promising and since Vala is developed by the GNOME project - with the purpose of making software development for, primarily, GNOME easier - and I'm an avid GNOME user I wanted ...</description>

		<title>Gravatar module for Roxen</title>
		<description>Although I'm working on some social web related Pike modules where a Gravatar module is included I needed a Gravatar module right now at work so I hacked up a standalone Gravatar Roxen module.

This is how it works

		<title>A change of times</title>

Times are changing! This old beer ad is in Swedish but in short it says: 


Pripps in a new disposable pack, for the sailing tripp. Extra tip: Make a hole in the bottom of the empty pack and it will sink faster.

It feels we at least have come some way ...</description>
